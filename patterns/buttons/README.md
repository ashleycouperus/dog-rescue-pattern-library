The buttons use our primary color to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for light backgrounds
- The light buttons are for dark background
- The ghost buttons should be on link cards, banners and over images

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
